description: "Provide your ${topk} best guesses for the following question about {subject} selecting one of the options and the probability that each guess is correct (0.0 to 1.0). Give ONLY the guesses and probabilities, no other words or explanation. For example:\n\nG1: <first most likely guess, only the selected option letter; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>\nP1: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G1 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>\n...\nG${topk}: <${topk}-th most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>\nP${topk}: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G${topk} is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>"
