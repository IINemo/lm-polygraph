description: "Provide your best guess for the following question about {subject} selecting one of the options and the probability that it is correct (0.0 to 1.0). Give ONLY the guess and probability, no other words or explanation. For example:\n\nGuess: <most likely guess, only the selected option letter; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>\nProbability: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that your guess is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>"
