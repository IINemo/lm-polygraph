G1: <first most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>
P1: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G1 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>
...
G4: <4-th most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>
P4: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G4 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>
