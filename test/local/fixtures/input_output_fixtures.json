{"coqa_input": "The following are stories and questions about them. Each story is followed by a question and answer to a given question.\n\nStory: When my father was dying, I traveled a thousand miles from home to be with him in his last days. It was far more heartbreaking than I'd expected, one of the most difficult and painful times in my life. After he passed away I stayed alone in his apartment. There were so many things to deal with. It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. \n\nBut one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep. \n\nThe next morning I checked with neighbors and learned that the cat had been abandoned by his owner who's moved out. So the little cat was there all alone, just like I was. As I walked back to the apartment, I tried to figure out what to do with him. Having something else to take care of seemed _ But as soon as I opened the apartment door he came running and jumped into my arms. It was clear from that moment that he had no intention of going anywhere. I started calling him Willis, in honor of my father's best friend. \n\nFrom then on, things grew easier. With Willis in my lap time seemed to pass much more quickly. When the time finally came for me to return home I had to decide what to do about Willis. There was absolutely no way I would leave without him. \n\nIt's now been five years since my father died. Over the years, several people have commented on how nice it was of me to rescue the cat. But I know that we rescued each other. I may have given him a home but he gave me something greater.\n\nQuestion: What was crying?\nAnswer:a cat\n\nQuestion: what did the author feed it?\nAnswer:yes\n\nQuestion: what did the author feed it?\nAnswer:fish\n\nQuestion: then what did the cat do?\nAnswer:fell asleep\n\nQuestion: where was the author?\nAnswer:his father's apartment.\n\nQuestion: was the father alive by then?\nAnswer:no\n\nQuestion: how far did the author travel?\nAnswer:a thousand miles\n\nQuestion: who did the author check about the cat with?\nAnswer:neighbors\n\nQuestion: what did he find out?\nAnswer:the cat was abandoned\n\nQuestion: by who?\nAnswer:his owner\n\nQuestion: what did he call him?\nAnswer:Willis\n\nQuestion: how long has he had him?\nAnswer:five years\n\nQuestion: who was he named after?\nAnswer:his father's best friend.\n\nQuestion: did the author go without him?\nAnswer:no\n\nQuestion: how did the author feel after his dad died?\nAnswer:heartbroken\n\nQuestion: did he expect it?\nAnswer:no\n\nQuestion: what did people say to him about Willis?\nAnswer:it was nice to rescue him\n\nQuestion: did he feel the same?\nAnswer:no\n\nQuestion: what did he feel?\nAnswer:they rescued each other\n\nQuestion: did he originally want to keep Willis?\nAnswer:", "coqa_output": "no", "triviaqa_input": "Question: What is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu?\nAnswer:chennai\nQuestion: Who rules Narnia following the reign of High King Peter in the Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S.
