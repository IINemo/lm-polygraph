Provide your 4 best guesses for the following question about sociology selecting one of the options and the probability that each guess is correct (0.0 to 1.0). Give ONLY the guesses and probabilities, no other words or explanation. For example:

G1: <first most likely guess, only the selected option letter; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>
P1: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G1 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>
...
G4: <4-th most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>
P4: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G4 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>
